			<p>
			<strong>Travelling </strong> is, in my opinion, the best way to learn about others and the cultures around us. I have had the chance to travel in several countries such as Indonesia or several European countries. I would like to discover other parts of the world during my studies such as South America and the United States.

			I have been practicing <strong>jazz dance </strong> since the age of 5: this activity is for me a way to let off steam and express my feelings 	other than through words.
